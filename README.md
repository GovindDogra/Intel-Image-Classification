# Intel-Image-Classification

1. Introduction
This project focuses on classifying images into different categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing images of buildings, forests, glaciers, mountains, seas, and streets. The goal is to achieve high classification accuracy and analyze the modelâ€™s performance through various evaluation metrics.
